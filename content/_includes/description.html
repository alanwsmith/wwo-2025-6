<p>The spacing on this one was a happy accident. 
  I was trying to add padding where the overall
  field stayed the same time and the individual
  cells had padding (which really would have
  been a border), but I tried margin and really
  liked the effect.

  I'm using <a href="https://bitty.alanwsmith.com/">bitty</a>
for the basic element connections. The code
  that does all the stuff is here below.
